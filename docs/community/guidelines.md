# Guidelines

At Digg, we're building communities that gather around shared interests. The internet has many platforms, and we've thoughtfully developed guidelines to help our community thrive. We believe in upholding a standard of integrity that sets us apart—which means Digg might not be for everyone, and we're okay with that.

That said, stagnation in thinking will be the death of us, so we're here to listen and modify them as we learn together. If you have suggestions for improvement, please share them—your perspective helps make Digg better for everyone.

We're excited to see what we'll build together with those who share our vision for more meaningful connection.

### 1. Respect Your Fellow Human
Our communities thrive when everyone can participate in a safe environment where healthy disagreement coexists with mutual respect. No harassment, bullying, hate speech, doxxing, discrimination, or advocating for violence. Content targeting people based on their identity or engaging in persistent negative behavior toward individuals or groups is prohibited. Content that graphically depicts real-world death or severe injury is not allowed.

### 2. Stay Legal
Operating within legal boundaries protects our community and ensures our platform's continued existence. Don't post, share, or coordinate anything that breaks the law. Illegal content or activities violate our [Terms of Service](https://docs.digg.com/terms).

No fraud, phishing, or coordination of unlawful activity, and no support for terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Selling drugs, firearms, or sexual services isn’t allowed either. 

### 3. Protect Kids
Safeguarding minors is a non-negotiable responsibility we all share. Don't share or encourage any sexual, abusive, or suggestive content involving people under 18. All predatory behavior involving minors is prohibited without exception.

### 4. No Explicit Content
Digg is not a place for sexually explicit content. That includes graphic sexual descriptions, pornographic material, sexual services, or posts that focus on sexual acts, genitals, or sexual arousal, whether direct or heavily implied.

### 5. Be Yourself
Trust requires authenticity; deception undermines our community's foundation. You don't need to use your real name, but don't impersonate others or misrepresent yourself in misleading ways.

We may allow users to have multiple personas tied to a single account in the future so they can participate in one community under one identity while choosing a different identity in more personal or sensitive spaces (or just to keep work and personal interests separate). In the meantime, we prefer users to have one account.

### 6. Honor Community Guidelines
Each community on Digg can define its own guidelines in addition to these site-wide guidelines. When you join or participate in a community, you agree to respect that community’s norms and culture. Follow the specific guidelines set by each community, even if they differ from other spaces or your usual online behavior.

### 7. Engage Genuinely
Digg works best when people participate in good faith. Share things you actually care about, join other people’s posts, and let your contributions earn attention naturally. Don't spam, artificially manipulate votes or engagement metrics, deliberately disrupt communities or create accounts just to game visibility or evade moderation.​

This also includes posting content primarily designed to drive external traffic, manipulate search rankings, or promote services through repetitive, templated, or low-value posts. Content should exist to contribute meaningful discussion, not to exploit visibility or marketing opportunities.

### 8. Protect Privacy
Sharing personal information can cause real‑world harm that’s impossible to undo. Never share someone else's personal information without permission or post intimate media without explicit consent. Don't use private information to harass or expose others.

### 9. Respect The Platform
We’re building this space together, and we’ve put technical boundaries in place to ensure everyone can enjoy it equally. Don’t exploit platform features or interfere with normal site functionality, including attempts to circumvent moderation or security measures.

## What Will Digg Do If These Guidelines Are Broken?

We use a tiered approach to user conduct violations based on severity and frequency. Depending on the nature of the violation, we may take actions including:

- Content removal  
- Temporary restrictions on posting, commenting, or voting  
- Community-specific removal  
- Account warnings  
- Temporary account suspension  
- Permanent account suspension

Digg is working on a fully transparent moderation system that will be an industry first and visible to all, eliminating all shadow banning. We believe in transparency and accountability in content moderation, allowing users to understand exactly what actions were taken and why.

If you believe any of your content was removed unnecessarily, please feel free to reach out to [help@digg.com](mailto:help@digg.com?subject=Content%20or%20Account%20Removal) with a link to the post or comment in question.
