This Privacy Policy describes how Digg, Inc. (“**Digg**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) handles personal information that we collect through our website or through any other websites that we own or control and that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “**Service**” or “**Services**”).

Please see our **Privacy Snapshot** below for a high-level overview of our privacy practices.

- **Payment information** needed to complete your transactions with us, including name, payment card information, and billing information. Your payment card information is processed by our service providers which will handle your information in accordance with their own privacy policy. We do not have access to your full payment card information.

- **Communications information**, such as data that we gather from you when you contact us with questions, feedback, or otherwise.

- **Marketing information**, such as your preferences for receiving our marketing communications and details about your engagement with them.

- **Feedback or correspondence**, such as information you provide when you contact us with questions, feedback, or otherwise correspond with us online.

- **Other data** not specifically listed here, which we will use as described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.

**Information we obtain from third parties:** We may maintain pages on social media platforms, such as Instagram, Meta, Reddit, and other third-party platforms. When you visit or interact with our pages on those platforms, the platform provider’s privacy policy will apply to your interactions and their collection, use, and processing of your personal information.

**Automatic data collection.** We and our service providers may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interactions over time with our website, our communications and other online services, such as:

- **Device data**, such as your computer’s or mobile device’s operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers, language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE, G), and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.

- **Online activity data**, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, browsing history, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, duration of access, and whether you have opened our marketing emails or clicked links within them.

**We use the following tools for automatic data collection:**

- **Cookies**, which are text files that websites store on a visitor‘s device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand website user activity and patterns, and for advertising purposes.

- **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.

- **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.

**How we use your personal information**

We use personal information for the following purposes or as otherwise described at the time of collection:

**To provide our Services**, we use your personal information to perform our contractual obligation towards you, or when it is in our legitimate business interests to do so, to provide you with the Services. This includes:

- **Interest-based advertising.** We may engage our advertising partners, including third-party advertising companies and social media companies, to display ads around the web. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interaction over time across our website, our communications, and other online services, and use that information to serve online ads that they think will interest you. We may also share information about our users with these companies to facilitate interest-based advertising to those or similar users on other online platforms. You can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising in the “Limit online tracking” section below.

Except where consent is required, we carry out marketing and advertising where it is in our legitimate business interests. Where we seek your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.

**To comply with legal obligations and to defend Digg against legal claims or disputes.** We may use your personal information to comply with our legal obligations or when it is in our legitimate business interests, which includes to:

- Comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities.
- Audit our internal processes for compliance with legal and contractual requirements and internal policies.
- Enforce the terms and conditions that govern our website.

- Where we have a legitimate interest, to protect our, your or others’ rights, privacy, safety or property (including by making and defending legal claims).

**How we disclose your personal information**

**Other users.** Digg is a social platform, and your information may be available to other users. This information can include attributes like your posts, user profile information, including the display name you select, the username you choose to use on Digg, avatars or images you elect to upload, and other information you enter on your profile (such as your bio), may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within Digg. Where we offer direct messaging features between users, this also includes anything you may share in direct messages. Please be careful about how you configure your Digg settings, and what actions you take on Digg.

**Affiliates.** We may disclose your personal information to our subsidiaries and affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Service providers.** We may disclose your personal information to third party companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate our services (such as lawyers, bankers, auditors, insurers, customer support, hosting, analytics, email delivery, marketing, and database management).

**Third parties.** Third parties, such as advertising companies, data providers, for interest-based advertising and other marketing purposes, including those third parties’ own purposes. To learn about your choices, please see the “Limit online tracking” section below.

**Authorities and others.** We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties, as we believe in good faith to be necessary or appropriate for the compliance and protection purposes described above.

**Business transfers.** We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our business or assets, including your personal information, in connection with a business transaction (or potential business transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy or dissolution. In such a case, we will make reasonable efforts to require the recipient to honor this Privacy Policy.

**International Data Transfers**

You will provide personal information directly to us in the United States. We may also transfer personal information to our affiliates and service providers in the United States and other jurisdictions. Please note that such jurisdictions may not provide the same protections as the data protection laws in your home country.

When we engage in cross-border data transfers, we will ensure that relevant safeguards are in place to afford adequate protection for personal information and we will comply with applicable data protection laws, in particular by relying on an EU Commission or UK government adequacy decision or on contractual protections for the transfer of personal information. For more information about how we transfer personal information internationally, please contact us as set out in the “How to contact us” section below.

**Your choices**

**Account Deletion.** Should you ever decide to delete your account, you may do so by visiting your account settings page. If you delete your account, any association between your account and information stored by, or in connection with, Digg will no longer be accessible. However, given the nature of sharing using Digg, any public activity on your account prior to deletion will remain stored on our servers and will remain accessible to the public. Digg will remove the username associated with the deleted account to anonymize the link between the content and the original poster but will not anonymize personal information contained in the content itself. After you submit a request to delete your account, it may take up to 90 days for our purge script to complete deletion.

**Accessing and Correcting Your Information.** You can access information associated with your account by logging into the web version of Digg, or through the Digg application. You can adjust settings and privacy preferences through your account settings.

**Data Subject Rights.** In addition to the above, depending on where you are based, and as provided under applicable law and subject to any limitations in such law, you may have the right to:

- **access** your personal information
- **correct** incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
- ask us to **erase** the personal information we hold about you
- ask us to **restrict** our handling of your personal information
- opt out of the **selling** of your personal information or **sharing** your information for interest-based advertising. By default, we do not sell or share your personal information.
- opt out of **“profiling”** in connection with decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. By default, we do not engage in this kind of profiling.
- receive any personal information we hold about you in a structured and commonly used **machine readable format** or have such personal information transmitted to another company
- **object** to how we are using your personal information
- **withdraw** your consent to us handling your personal information

To make a request, please email us or write to us as provided in the “How to contact us” section below. Please note that, prior to any response to the exercise of such rights, we may require you to verify your identity. Depending on where you reside, you may be entitled to empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on your behalf. We will require authorized agents to confirm their identity and authority, in accordance with applicable laws. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. In addition, we may have valid legal reasons to refuse your request, and will inform you if that is the case.

**Limits on your privacy rights and choices.** In some instances, your choices may be limited, such as where fulfilling your request would impair the rights of others, our ability to provide a service you have requested, or our ability to comply with our legal obligations and enforce our legal rights. If you are not satisfied with how we address your request, you may submit a complaint by contacting us as provided in the “How to Contact Us” section below.

**Opt out of marketing communications.** You may opt out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.

**Limit online tracking.** There are a number of ways to limit online tracking, which we have summarized below. Please note that these tools are not associated with us and we cannot guarantee that they work as their providers advertise them:

- **Blocking cookies in your browser.** Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit [https://www.allaboutcookies.org/](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

- **Using privacy plug-ins or browsers.** You can block our websites from setting cookies by using a browser with privacy features, like [Brave](https://brave.com/), or installing browser plugins like [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/), [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/), or [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), and configuring them to block third party cookies/trackers. You can also opt out of Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

- **Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings.** Your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.

  - [Google](https://adssettings.google.com/)
  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/advertising)

  - [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://optout.aboutads.info/)

Note that because these opt-out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt out on every browser and device that you use.

We do not control third party websites, mobile applications or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites and mobile applications and online services you use.

**Retention of Personal Information**

Where required under applicable laws, we retain personal information only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected and processed, in accordance with our retention policies, and in accordance with applicable laws and regulatory obligations.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information, the purposes for which we use personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

We employ a number of technical, organizational, and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect. However, no security measures are failsafe and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

Our website is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information through the website from a child under 13 without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will delete it.
